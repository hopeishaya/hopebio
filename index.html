    <p>Hello! My name is Hope Ishaya from Nigeria. My deep curiosity and passion for technology led me to explore the tech industry. Currently, I am studying Frontend Engineering at AltSchool Africa.</p>

    <p>I am a societal engineer. I love to study my environment and make interactions with people easier. My journey began with a fascination for how digital systems work. While pursuing sociology, I realized that technology plays a pivotal role in shaping societies and our everyday lives. This realization led me to pursue a career in tech.</p>

    <p>I love to read and conduct research. I also enjoy traveling, learning new ideas and experiences. I am on a journey to being creative, engaging with communities, and aspiring to be a tech enthusiast.</p>
